List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML

1. Use Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML tags clearly describe their meaning in a way that is understandable both to the browser and to assistive technologies.

2. Provide Alternative Text for Images
Alternative text (alt text) is used to describe the content of images, which is crucial for users relying on screen readers.

3. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility
Make sure all interactive elements (like links, buttons, forms) can be accessed and operated via keyboard alone.
